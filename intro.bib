  abstract = {We introduce the notion of local spectral expansion of a simplicial complex as a possible analogue of spectral expansion defined for graphs. We then show that the condition of local spectral expansion for a complex yields various spectral gaps in both the links of the complex and the global Laplacians of the complex.},
